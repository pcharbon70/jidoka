> **Composable, validated actions for Elixir applications with built-in AI tool integration**

_`Jido.Action` is part of the [Jido](https://github.com/agentjido/jido) project. Learn more about Jido at [agentjido.xyz](https://agentjido.xyz)._

## Overview

`Jido.Action` is a framework for building composable, validated actions in Elixir. It provides a standardized way to define discrete units of functionality that can be composed into complex workflows, validated at compile and runtime using NimbleOptions schemas, and seamlessly integrated with AI systems through automatic tool generation.

Whether you're building microservices that need structured operations, implementing agent-based systems, or creating AI-powered applications that require reliable function calling, Jido.Action provides the foundation for robust, traceable, and scalable action-driven architecture.

## Why Do I Need Actions?

**Structured Operations in Elixir's Dynamic World**

Elixir excels at building fault-tolerant, concurrent systems, but as applications grow, you often need:

- **Standardized Operation Format**: Raw function calls lack structure, validation, and metadata
- **AI Tool Integration**: Converting functions to LLM-compatible tool definitions manually
- **Workflow Composition**: Building complex multi-step processes from smaller units
- **Parameter Validation**: Ensuring inputs are correct before expensive operations
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error reporting across different operation types
- **Runtime Introspection**: Understanding what operations are available and how they work

```elixir
# Traditional Elixir functions
def process_order(order_id, user_id, options) do
  # No validation, no metadata, no AI integration
  # Error handling is inconsistent
end

# With Jido.Action
defmodule ProcessOrder do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "process_order",
    description: "Processes a customer order with validation and tracking",
    schema: [
      order_id: [type: :string, required: true],
      user_id: [type: :string, required: true],
      priority: [type: {:in, [:low, :normal, :high]}, default: :normal]
    ]

  def run(params, context) do
    # Params are pre-validated, action is AI-ready, errors are structured
    {:ok, %{status: "processed", order_id: params.order_id}}
  end
end

# Use directly or convert to AI tool
ProcessOrder.to_tool()  # Ready for LLM integration
```

Jido.Action transforms ad-hoc functions into structured, validated, AI-compatible operations that scale from simple tasks to complex agent workflows.

## Installation

Add `jido_action` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jido_action, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then run:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Define Your First Action

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Actions.GreetUser do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "greet_user",
    description: "Greets a user with a personalized message",
    category: "communication",
    tags: ["greeting", "user"],
    vsn: "1.0.0",
    schema: [
      name: [type: :string, required: true, doc: "User's name"],
      language: [type: {:in, ["en", "es", "fr"]}, default: "en", doc: "Greeting language"]
    ]

  @impl true
  def run(params, _context) do
    greeting = case params.language do
      "en" -> "Hello"
      "es" -> "Hola" 
      "fr" -> "Bonjour"
    end
    
    {:ok, %{message: "#{greeting}, #{params.name}!"}}
  end
end
```

### 2. Execute Actions with Jido.Exec

```elixir
# Synchronous execution
{:ok, result} = Jido.Exec.run(MyApp.Actions.GreetUser, %{name: "Alice"})
# => {:ok, %{message: "Hello, Alice!"}}

# With validation error handling
{:error, reason} = Jido.Exec.run(MyApp.Actions.GreetUser, %{invalid: "params"})
# => {:error, %Jido.Action.Error{type: :validation_error, ...}}

# Asynchronous execution
async_ref = Jido.Exec.run_async(MyApp.Actions.GreetUser, %{name: "Bob"})
{:ok, result} = Jido.Exec.await(async_ref)
```

### 3. Create Workflows with Jido.Instruction

```elixir
# Define a sequence of actions
instructions = [
  MyApp.Actions.ValidateUser,
  {MyApp.Actions.GreetUser, %{name: "Alice", language: "es"}},
  MyApp.Actions.LogActivity
]

# Normalize with shared context
{:ok, workflow} = Jido.Instruction.normalize(instructions, %{
  request_id: "req_123",
  tenant_id: "tenant_456"
})

# Execute the workflow
Enum.each(workflow, fn instruction ->
  Jido.Exec.run(instruction.action, instruction.params, instruction.context)
end)
```

### 4. AI Tool Integration

```elixir
# Convert action to AI tool format
tool_definition = MyApp.Actions.GreetUser.to_tool()

# Returns LangChain-compatible tool definition:
%{
  name: "greet_user",
  description: "Greets a user with a personalized message",
  function: #Function<...>,  # Executes the action
  parameters_schema: %{
    "type" => "object",
    "properties" => %{
      "name" => %{"type" => "string", "description" => "User's name"},
      "language" => %{
        "type" => "string", 
        "enum" => ["en", "es", "fr"],
        "description" => "Greeting language"
      }
    },
    "required" => ["name"]
  }
}

# Use with AI frameworks - the function can be called directly
# or convert to OpenAI format for function calling
```

## Advanced Features

### Error Handling and Compensation

Actions support sophisticated error handling with optional compensation:

```elixir
defmodule RobustAction do
  use Jido.Action,
    name: "robust_action",
    compensation: [
      enabled: true,
      max_retries: 3,
      timeout: 5000
    ]

  def run(params, context) do
    # Main action logic
    {:ok, result}
  end

  # Called when errors occur if compensation is enabled
  def on_error(failed_params, error, context, opts) do
    # Perform rollback/cleanup operations
    {:ok, %{compensated: true, original_error: error}}
  end
end
```

### Lifecycle Hooks

Customize action behavior with lifecycle hooks:

```elixir
defmodule CustomAction do
  use Jido.Action, name: "custom_action"

  def on_before_validate_params(params) do
    # Transform params before validation
    {:ok, transformed_params}
  end

  def on_after_validate_params(params) do
    # Enrich params after validation
    {:ok, enriched_params}
  end

  def on_after_run({:ok, result}) do
    # Post-process successful results
    {:ok, enhanced_result}
  end
  
  def on_after_run({:error, _} = error), do: error
end
```

### Telemetry Integration

Actions emit telemetry events for monitoring:

```elixir
# Attach telemetry handlers
:telemetry.attach("action-handler", [:jido, :action, :stop], fn event, measurements, metadata, config ->
  # Handle action completion events
  Logger.info("Action completed: #{metadata.action}")
end, %{})
```

## Testing

Test actions directly or within the execution framework:

```elixir
defmodule MyActionTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  test "action validates parameters" do
    assert {:error, _} = MyAction.validate_params(%{invalid: "params"})
    assert {:ok, _} = MyAction.validate_params(%{valid: "params"})
  end

  test "action execution" do
    assert {:ok, result} = Jido.Exec.run(MyAction, %{valid: "params"})
    assert result.status == "success"
  end

  test "async action execution" do
    async_ref = Jido.Exec.run_async(MyAction, %{valid: "params"})
    assert {:ok, result} = Jido.Exec.await(async_ref, 5000)
  end
end
```

## Configuration

Configure defaults in your application:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :jido_action,
  default_timeout: 10_000,
  default_max_retries: 3,
  default_backoff: 500
```

### Instance Isolation (Multi-Tenant)

For multi-tenant applications, route execution through instance-scoped supervisors:

```elixir
# Add instance supervisor to your supervision tree
children = [
  {Task.Supervisor, name: MyApp.Jido.TaskSupervisor}
]

# Execute with instance isolation
{:ok, result} = Jido.Exec.run(MyAction, params, context, jido: MyApp.Jido)
```

When `jido: MyApp.Jido` is provided, all tasks spawn under `MyApp.Jido.TaskSupervisor` instead of the global supervisor, ensuring complete isolation between tenants.
