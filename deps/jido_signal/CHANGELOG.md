## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0-rc.4] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- Removed quokka from dev dependencies (#74)
- Removed unused {:private} dependency (#75)

## [2.0.0-rc.3] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- Elixir 1.18 compatibility (#73)

### Changed
- Bump zoi from 0.16.1 to 0.17.0
- Bump credo from 1.7.15 to 1.7.16
- Bump ex_doc from 0.40.0 to 0.40.1

## [2.0.0-rc.2] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- Instance isolation support for multi-tenant deployments via `jido:` option

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Removed `typed_struct` dependency - all structs now use Zoi-based definitions
- Refactored helpers extraction and improved code organization
- Hardened ETS cleanup in tests

### Fixed
- TrieNode.handlers default in Router

## [1.1.0] - 2025-06-18

### Added
- Parallel dispatch processing for multiple targets with configurable concurrency (default: 8)
- Configuration option `:dispatch_max_concurrency` to control parallel dispatch concurrency
- Self-call detection for Named adapter in sync mode to prevent deadlocks
- Payload size limits and schema validation for Signal serialization

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `dispatch/2` with multiple configs now returns `{:error, [errors]}` instead of first error only
- Removed double validation overhead (internal optimization - no API impact)
- Simplified batch processing to use single async stream (internal optimization)
- Improved batch dispatch concurrency defaults from 5 to 8
- Deprecated `jido_dispatch` field in Signal struct

### Deprecated
- `batch_size` option in `dispatch_batch/3` - kept for backwards compatibility but no longer used

### Performance
- ~40% reduction in hot-path overhead from eliminating double validation
- Significant speedup for multi-target dispatch (e.g., 10 targets with 100ms latency: ~200ms vs ~1000ms sequential)
- **Router optimizations (50-100x improvement in pattern matching):**
  - Optimized `Router.matches?/2` - eliminated trie build and UUID generation per call
  - Optimized multi-wildcard (`**`) matching - reduced memory allocations
  - Optimized `route_count` tracking - O(N) → O(1) for removal operations
  - Optimized `has_route?/2` - O(N) → O(depth) direct trie lookup
  - Optimized trie build - precomputed segments to avoid repeated string splits

### Fixed
- Named adapter now prevents self-call deadlocks in sync delivery mode
- Documentation examples and bugs (Fixes #11, #12, Refs #13)
- Flaky DispatchTest by isolating tests that modify global Application env

## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-03

### Added
- Initial release of Jido Signal
- Signal processing and event handling framework
- Bus-based pub/sub system with adapters
- Signal routing with pattern matching
- Multiple dispatch adapters: `:pid`, `:pubsub`, `:http`, `:bus`, `:named`, `:console`, `:logger`, `:noop`
- In-memory persistence via ETS
- Middleware pipeline support
- Comprehensive test suite with 80%+ coverage
- Documentation with guides and examples
- OTP supervision tree architecture
