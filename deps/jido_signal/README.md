> **Agent Communication Envelope and Utilities**

_`Jido.Signal` is part of the [Jido](https://github.com/agentjido/jido) project. Learn more about Jido at [agentjido.xyz](https://agentjido.xyz)._

## Overview

`Jido.Signal` is a sophisticated toolkit for building event-driven and agent-based systems in Elixir. It provides a complete ecosystem for defining, routing, dispatching, and tracking signals throughout your application, built on the CloudEvents v1.0.2 specification with powerful Jido-specific extensions.

Whether you're building microservices that need reliable event communication, implementing complex agent-based systems, or creating observable distributed applications, Jido.Signal provides the foundation for robust, traceable, and scalable event-driven architecture.

## Why Do I Need Signals?

**Agent Communication in Elixir's Process-Driven World**

Elixir's strength lies in lightweight processes that communicate via message passing, but raw message passing has limitations when building complex systems:

- **Phoenix Channels** need structured event broadcasting across connections
- **GenServers** require reliable inter-process communication with context
- **Agent Systems** demand traceable conversations between autonomous processes
- **Distributed Services** need standardized message formats across nodes

Traditional Elixir messaging (`send`, `GenServer.cast/call`) works great for simple scenarios, but falls short when you need:

- **Standardized Message Format**: Raw tuples and maps lack structure and metadata
- **Event Routing**: Broadcasting to multiple interested processes based on patterns
- **Conversation Tracking**: Understanding which message caused which response
- **Reliable Delivery**: Ensuring critical messages aren't lost if a process crashes
- **Cross-System Integration**: Communicating with external services via webhooks/HTTP

```elixir
# Traditional Elixir messaging
GenServer.cast(my_server, {:user_created, user_id, email})  # Unstructured
send(pid, {:event, data})  # No routing or reliability

# With Jido.Signal
{:ok, signal} = UserCreated.new(%{user_id: user_id, email: email})
Bus.publish(:app_bus, [signal])  # Structured, routed, traceable, reliable
```

Jido.Signal transforms Elixir's message passing into a sophisticated communication system that scales from simple GenServer interactions to complex multi-agent orchestration across distributed systems.

## Installation

Add `jido_signal` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jido_signal, "~> 1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then run:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start a Signal Bus

Add to your application's supervision tree:

```elixir
# In your application.ex
children = [
  {Jido.Signal.Bus, name: :my_app_bus}
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

### 2. Create a Subscriber

```elixir
defmodule MySubscriber do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(_opts), do: GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, %{})
  def init(state), do: {:ok, state}

  # Handle incoming signals
  def handle_info({:signal, signal}, state) do
    IO.puts("Received: #{signal.type}")
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

### 3. Subscribe and Publish

```elixir
alias Jido.Signal.Bus
alias Jido.Signal

# Start subscriber and subscribe to user events
{:ok, sub_pid} = MySubscriber.start_link([])
{:ok, _sub_id} = Bus.subscribe(:my_app_bus, "user.*", dispatch: {:pid, target: sub_pid})

# Create and publish a signal
# Preferred: positional constructor (type, data, attrs)
{:ok, signal} = Signal.new("user.created", %{user_id: "123", email: "user@example.com"},
  source: "/auth/registration"
)

# Also available: Map/keyword constructor (backwards compatible)
{:ok, signal} = Signal.new(%{
  type: "user.created",
  source: "/auth/registration",
  data: %{user_id: "123", email: "user@example.com"}
})

Bus.publish(:my_app_bus, [signal])
# Output: "Received: user.created"
```

## Core Concepts

### The Signal

Signals are CloudEvents-compliant message envelopes that carry your application's events:

```elixir
# Basic signal with positional constructor (preferred)
{:ok, signal} = Signal.new("order.created", %{order_id: "ord_123", amount: 99.99},
  source: "/ecommerce/orders"
)

# Map constructor (also available)
{:ok, signal} = Signal.new(%{
  type: "order.created",
  source: "/ecommerce/orders",
  data: %{order_id: "ord_123", amount: 99.99}
})

# Dispatch is configured when subscribing or dispatching, not on the signal
:ok = Dispatch.dispatch(signal, [
  {:pubsub, target: MyApp.PubSub, topic: "payments"},
  {:webhook, url: "https://api.partner.com/webhook", secret: "secret123"}
])
```

### Custom Signal Types

Define strongly-typed signals with validation:

```elixir
defmodule UserCreated do
  use Jido.Signal,
    type: "user.created.v1",
    default_source: "/users",
    schema: [
      user_id: [type: :string, required: true],
      email: [type: :string, required: true],
      name: [type: :string, required: true]
    ]
end

# Usage
{:ok, signal} = UserCreated.new(%{
  user_id: "u_123",
  email: "john@example.com",
  name: "John Doe"
})

# Validation errors
{:error, reason} = UserCreated.new(%{user_id: "u_123"})
# => {:error, "Invalid data for Signal: Required key :email not found"}
```

### The Router

Powerful pattern matching for signal routing:

```elixir
alias Jido.Signal.Router

routes = [
  # Exact matches have highest priority
  {"user.created", :handle_user_creation},
  
  # Single-level wildcards
  {"user.*.updated", :handle_user_updates},
  
  # Multi-level wildcards
  {"audit.**", :audit_logger, 100},  # High priority
  
  # Pattern matching functions
  {"**", fn signal -> String.contains?(signal.type, "error") end, :error_handler}
]

{:ok, router} = Router.new(routes)

# Route signals to handlers
{:ok, targets} = Router.route(router, Jido.Signal.new!("user.profile.updated", %{}))
# => {:ok, [:handle_user_updates]}
```

### Dispatch System

Flexible delivery to multiple destinations:

```elixir
alias Jido.Signal.Dispatch

dispatch_configs = [
  # Send to process
  {:pid, target: my_process_pid},
  
  # Publish via Phoenix.PubSub
  {:pubsub, target: MyApp.PubSub, topic: "events"},
  
  # HTTP webhook with signature
  {:webhook, url: "https://api.example.com/webhook", secret: "secret123"},
  
  # Log structured data
  {:logger, level: :info, structured: true},
  
  # Console output
  {:console, format: :pretty}
]

# Synchronous dispatch
:ok = Dispatch.dispatch(signal, dispatch_configs)

# Asynchronous dispatch
{:ok, task} = Dispatch.dispatch_async(signal, dispatch_configs)
```

## Advanced Features

### Persistent Subscriptions

Track signal acknowledgments for reliable processing:

```elixir
# Create persistent subscription with full options
{:ok, sub_id} = Bus.subscribe(:my_app_bus, "payment.*",
  persistent: true,
  dispatch: {:pid, target: self()},
  max_in_flight: 100,      # Max unacknowledged signals
  max_pending: 5_000,      # Max queued signals before backpressure
  max_attempts: 5,         # Retry attempts before DLQ
  retry_interval: 500      # Milliseconds between retries
)

# Receive and acknowledge signals
receive do
  {:signal, signal} ->
    # Process the signal
    process_payment(signal)

    # Acknowledge successful processing
    Bus.ack(:my_app_bus, sub_id, signal.id)
end

# After max_attempts failures, signals move to Dead Letter Queue
# See Event Bus guide for DLQ management
```

### Middleware Pipeline

Add cross-cutting concerns with middleware:

```elixir
middleware = [
  # Built-in logging middleware
  {Jido.Signal.Bus.Middleware.Logger, [
    level: :info,
    include_signal_data: true
  ]},
  
  # Custom middleware
  {MyApp.AuthMiddleware, []},
  {MyApp.MetricsMiddleware, []}
]

{:ok, _pid} = Jido.Signal.Bus.start_link(
  name: :my_bus, 
  middleware: middleware
)
```

Middleware callbacks (`before_publish`, `after_publish`, `before_dispatch`, `after_dispatch`) are executed with timeout protection (default 100ms, configurable via `middleware_timeout_ms`). Slow middleware is terminated and the operation continues. See `Jido.Signal.Bus.Middleware.Logger` for a complete implementation example.

### Causality Tracking

Track signal relationships for complete system observability:

```elixir
alias Jido.Signal.Journal

# Create journal
journal = Journal.new()

# Record causal relationships
Journal.record(journal, initial_signal, nil)  # Root cause
Journal.record(journal, response_signal, initial_signal.id)  # Caused by initial_signal
Journal.record(journal, side_effect, initial_signal.id)     # Also caused by initial_signal

# Analyze relationships
effects = Journal.get_effects(journal, initial_signal.id)
# => [response_signal, side_effect]

cause = Journal.get_cause(journal, response_signal.id)
# => initial_signal
```

### Signal History & Replay

Access complete signal history:

```elixir
# Get recent signals matching pattern
{:ok, signals} = Bus.replay(:my_app_bus, "user.*", 
  since: DateTime.utc_now() |> DateTime.add(-3600, :second),
  limit: 100
)

# Replay to new subscriber
{:ok, new_sub} = Bus.subscribe(:my_app_bus, "user.*", 
  dispatch: {:pid, target: new_process_pid},
  replay_since: DateTime.utc_now() |> DateTime.add(-1800, :second)
)
```

### Snapshots

Create point-in-time views of your signal log:

```elixir
# Create filtered snapshot
{:ok, snapshot_id} = Bus.snapshot_create(:my_app_bus, %{
  path_pattern: "order.**",
  since: ~U[2024-01-01 00:00:00Z],
  until: ~U[2024-01-31 23:59:59Z]
})

# Read snapshot data
{:ok, signals} = Bus.snapshot_read(:my_app_bus, snapshot_id)

# Export or analyze the signals
Enum.each(signals, &analyze_order_signal/1)
```

### Instance Isolation

For multi-tenant applications or testing, create isolated signal infrastructure:

```elixir
# Start an isolated instance with its own Registry, TaskSupervisor, etc.
{:ok, _} = Jido.Signal.Instance.start_link(name: MyApp.Jido)

# Start buses scoped to the instance
{:ok, _} = Jido.Signal.Bus.start_link(name: :tenant_bus, jido: MyApp.Jido)

# Lookup uses the correct instance registry
{:ok, bus_pid} = Jido.Signal.Bus.whereis(:tenant_bus, jido: MyApp.Jido)

# Multiple instances are completely isolated
{:ok, _} = Jido.Signal.Instance.start_link(name: TenantA.Jido)
{:ok, _} = Jido.Signal.Instance.start_link(name: TenantB.Jido)

# Same bus name, different instances = different processes
{:ok, _} = Jido.Signal.Bus.start_link(name: :events, jido: TenantA.Jido)
{:ok, _} = Jido.Signal.Bus.start_link(name: :events, jido: TenantB.Jido)
```

## Use Cases

### Microservices Communication
```elixir
# Service A publishes order events
{:ok, signal} = OrderCreated.new(%{order_id: "123", customer_id: "456"})
Bus.publish(:event_bus, [signal])

# Service B processes inventory
# Service C sends notifications  
# Service D updates analytics
```

### Agent-Based Systems
```elixir
# Agents communicate via signals
{:ok, signal} = AgentMessage.new(%{
  from_agent: "agent_1",
  to_agent: "agent_2", 
  action: "negotiate_price",
  data: %{product_id: "prod_123", offered_price: 99.99}
})
```

### Event Sourcing
```elixir
# Commands become events
{:ok, command_signal} = CreateUser.new(user_data)
{:ok, event_signal} = UserCreated.new(user_data, cause: command_signal.id)

# Store in journal for complete audit trail
Journal.record(journal, event_signal, command_signal.id)
```

### Distributed Workflows
```elixir
# Coordinate multi-step processes
workflow_signals = [
  %Signal{type: "workflow.started", data: %{workflow_id: "wf_123"}},
  %Signal{type: "step.completed", data: %{step: 1, workflow_id: "wf_123"}},
  %Signal{type: "step.completed", data: %{step: 2, workflow_id: "wf_123"}},
  %Signal{type: "workflow.completed", data: %{workflow_id: "wf_123"}}
]
```
